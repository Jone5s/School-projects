This program was created as a course final project. I got a grade of 5 for this. 
The programs language is finnish.

The program is supposed to work like a school administration program where the user can manage students, teachers, courses and the relations between them.

It has a lot of debugging messages about constructos and desctructors. The code has few comments as I named the classes and functions in a way that you get a good idea of what it does.
The variable, function and class names are in finnish as well as the comments.
